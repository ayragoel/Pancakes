First in a large bowl, combine the eggs with sugar in it. Beat them well until it is well blended. Make sure the sugar is well dissolved. So blend it for around a minute. Next add in the vanilla extract and again mix it well. After this add in the all purpose flour along with honey and blend it until it is smooth and free from any kind of lumps. Now take the water in a seperate bowl and add in the baking soda and mix it well until it is completely dissolved. After this add in the water mixture into the batter and beat it well until it is well combined. But do not overbeat it. Now the batter for the pancakes is ready. Let it rest for around 10-15 minutes. Now grease a pan with oil and heat the pan on medium heat. Now pour the batter on the pan and let your pancakes cook. Your pancakes after following all these steps will be ready.
